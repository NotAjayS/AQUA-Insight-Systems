##  Features
🔹 Real-Time Water Level Monitoring
     The system continuously monitors water levels in real time, ensuring that users always have access to the most up-to-date information. This feature helps in identifying sudden changes in water levels, enabling faster response and efficient resource management.

🔹 Comprehensive Dashboard Analytics
     The dashboard provides a detailed analytical view of water usage and availability across daily, monthly, and yearly timelines. Through structured panels and visual indicators, users can easily understand consumption patterns and system performance.

🔹 Automated Overflow and Low-Level Alerts
     The application automatically detects abnormal water conditions such as overflow or critically low water levels. When such conditions occur, alert indicators are triggered to help prevent water wastage, equipment damage, and supply interruptions.

🔹 Motor Control and Operational Status
     The system displays the current operational status of water motors, allowing users to monitor whether motors are running, stopped, or in standby mode. This helps ensure efficient motor usage and prevents unnecessary power consumption.

🔹 Historical Data Storage and Analysis
     All water-related data is securely stored in the cloud, allowing users to review historical records at any time. This enables trend analysis, better planning, and informed decision-making for long-term water management.
